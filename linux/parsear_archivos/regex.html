<H3>Regular Expression Overview</H3></A>

Regular expression matching allows you to test whether a string fits
into a specific syntactic shape. You can also search a string for a
substring that fits a pattern.<P>
A regular expression describes a set of strings. The simplest case
is one that describes a particular string; for example, the string
'foo' when regarded as a regular expression matches 'foo' and nothing
else. Nontrivial regular expressions use certain special constructs
so that they can match more than one string. For example, the
regular expression 'foo\|bar' matches either the string 'foo' or the
string 'bar'; the regular expression 'c[ad]*r' matches any of the
strings 'cr', 'car', 'cdr', 'caar', 'cadddar' and all other such
strings with any number of 'a''s and 'd''s.<P>
The first step in matching a regular expression is to compile it. 
You must supply the pattern string and also a pattern buffer to hold
the compiled result. That result contains the pattern in an internal
format that is easier to use in matching.<P>
Having compiled a pattern, you can match it against strings. You can
match the compiled pattern any number of times against different
strings.<P>

<H3>Syntax of Regular Expressions</H3></A>

Regular expressions have a syntax in which a few characters are
special constructs and the rest are "ordinary". An ordinary
character is a simple regular expression which matches that character
and nothing else. The special characters are '\$', '^', '.', '*',
'+', '?', '[', ']' and '\'. Any other character appearing in a
regular expression is ordinary, unless a '\' precedes it.<P>
For example, 'f' is not a special character, so it is ordinary, and
therefore 'f' is a regular expression that matches the string 'f' and
no other string. (It does *not* match the string 'ff'.) Likewise,
'o' is a regular expression that matches only 'o'.<P>
Any two regular expressions A and B can be concatenated. The result
is a regular expression which matches a string if A matches some
amount of the beginning of that string and B matches the rest of the
string.<P>
As a simple example, we can concatenate the regular expressions 'f'
and 'o' to get the regular expression 'fo', which matches only the
string 'fo'. Still trivial.<P>
Note: for Unix compatibility, special characters are treated as
ordinary ones if they are in contexts where their special meanings
make no sense. For example, '*foo' treats '*' as ordinary since
there is no preceding expression on which the '*' can act. It is
poor practice to depend on this behavior; better to quote the special
character anyway, regardless of where is appears.<P>
The following are the characters and character sequences which have
special meaning within regular expressions. Any character not
mentioned here is not special; it stands for exactly itself for the
purposes of searching and matching.<P>
<UL>

<LI> 
<TT>.</TT> is a special character that matches anything except a newline. 
Using concatenation, we can make regular expressions like <TT>a.b</TT>
which matches any three-character string which begins with <TT>a</TT>
and ends with <TT>b</TT>.<P>
<LI> 
<TT>*</TT> is not a construct by itself; it is a suffix, which means the
preceding regular expression is to be repeated as many times as
possible. In <TT>fo*</TT>, the <TT>*</TT> applies to the <TT>o</TT>, so <TT>fo*</TT>
matches <TT>f</TT> followed by any number of <TT>o</TT>'s.<P>
The case of zero <TT>o</TT>'s is allowed: <TT>fo*</TT> does match <TT>f</TT>.<P>
<TT>*</TT> always applies to the *smallest* possible preceding
expression. Thus, <TT>fo*</TT> has a repeating <TT>o</TT>, not a repeating
<TT>fo</TT>.<P>
The matcher processes a <TT>*</TT> construct by matching, immediately,
as many repetitions as can be found. Then it continues with the
rest of the pattern. If that fails, backtracking occurs,
discarding some of the matches of the <TT>*</TT>'d construct in case
that makes it possible to match the rest of the pattern. For
example, matching <TT>c[ad]*ar</TT> against the string <TT>caddaar</TT>, the
<TT>[ad]*</TT> first matches <TT>addaa</TT>, but this does not allow the next
<TT>a</TT> in the pattern to match. So the last of the matches of
<TT>[ad]</TT> is undone and the following <TT>a</TT> is tried again. Now it
succeeds.<P>
<LI> 
<TT>+</TT> is like <TT>*</TT> except that at least one match for the preceding
pattern is required for <TT>+</TT>. Thus, <TT>c[ad]+r</TT> does not match
<TT>cr</TT> but does match anything else that <TT>c[ad]*r</TT> would match.<P>
<LI> 
<TT>?</TT> is like <TT>*</TT> except that it allows either zero or one match
for the preceding pattern. Thus, <TT>c[ad]?r</TT> matches <TT>cr</TT> or
<TT>car</TT> or <TT>cdr</TT>, and nothing else.<P>
<LI> 
<TT>[</TT> begins a "character set", which is terminated by a <TT>]</TT>. In
the simplest case, the characters between the two form the set. 
Thus, <TT>[ad]</TT> matches either <TT>a</TT> or <TT>d</TT>, and <TT>[ad]*</TT> matches any
string of <TT>a</TT>'s and <TT>d</TT>'s (including the empty string), from
which it follows that <TT>c[ad]*r</TT> matches <TT>car</TT>, etc.<P>
Character ranges can also be included in a character set, by
writing two characters with a <TT>-</TT> between them. Thus, <TT>[a-z]</TT>
matches any lower-case letter. Ranges may be intermixed freely
with individual characters, as in <TT>[a-z$%.]</TT>, which matches any
lower case letter or <TT>$</TT>, <TT>%</TT> or period.<P>
Note that the usual special characters are not special any more
inside a character set. A completely different set of special
characters exists inside character sets: <TT>]</TT>, <TT>-</TT> and ^.<P>
To include a <TT>]</TT> in a character set, you must make it the first
character. For example, <TT>[<CENTER></CENTER>]a]</TT> matches <TT>]</TT> or <TT>a</TT>. To include
a <TT>-</TT>, you must use it in a context where it cannot possibly
indicate a range: that is, as the first character, or
immediately after a range.<P>
<LI> 
[^ begins a "complement character set", which matches any
character except the ones specified. Thus, [^a-z0-9A-Z]
matches all characters <I>except</I> letters and digits.<P>
<LI> 
^ is not special in a character set unless it is the first
character. The character following the ^ is treated as if it
were first (it may be a <TT>-</TT> or a <TT>]</TT>).<P>
^ is a special character that matches the empty string -- but only
if at the beginning of a line in the text being matched. 
Otherwise it fails to match anything. Thus, ^foo matches a
<TT>foo</TT> which occurs at the beginning of a line.<P>
<LI> 
<TT>$</TT> 
is similar to ^ but matches only at the end of a line. Thus,
<TT>xx*$</TT> matches a string of one or more <TT>x</TT>'s at the end of a line.<P>
<LI> 
<TT>\</TT> 
has two functions: it quotes the above special characters
(including <TT>\</TT>), and it introduces additional special constructs.<P>
Because <TT>\</TT> quotes special characters, <TT>\$</TT> is a regular
expression which matches only <TT>$</TT>, and <TT>\<CENTER></CENTER>[</TT> is a regular
expression which matches only <TT>[</TT>, and so on.<P>
For the most part, <TT>\</TT> followed by any character matches only
that character. However, there are several exceptions:
characters which, when preceded by <TT>\</TT>, are special constructs. 
Such characters are always ordinary when encountered on their own.<P>
No new special characters will ever be defined. All extensions
to the regular expression syntax are made by defining new
two-character constructs that begin with <TT>\</TT>.<P>
<LI> 
<TT>\|</TT> 
specifies an alternative. Two regular expressions A and B with
<TT>\|</TT> in between form an expression that matches anything that
either A or B will match.<P>
Thus, <TT>foo\|bar</TT> matches either <TT>foo</TT> or <TT>bar</TT> but no other
string.<P>
<TT>\|</TT> applies to the largest possible surrounding expressions. 
Only a surrounding <TT>\( ... \)</TT> grouping can limit the grouping
power of <TT>\|</TT>.<P>
Full backtracking capability exists when multiple <TT>\|</TT>'s are used.<P>
<LI> 
<TT>\( ... \)</TT> 
is a grouping construct that serves three purposes:
<OL>

<LI> To enclose a set of <TT>\|</TT> alternatives for other operations.
Thus, <TT>\(foo\|bar\)x</TT> matches either <TT>foox</TT> or <TT>barx</TT>.
<LI> To enclose a complicated expression for the postfix <TT>*</TT> to
operate on. Thus, <TT>ba\(na\)*</TT> matches <TT>bananana</TT>, etc.,
with any (zero or more) number of <TT>na</TT>'s.
<LI> To mark a matched substring for future reference.
</OL>
<P>
This last application is not a consequence of the idea of a
parenthetical grouping; it is a separate feature which happens
to be assigned as a second meaning to the same <TT>\( ... \)</TT> 
construct because there is no conflict in practice between the
two meanings. Here is an explanation of this feature:<P>
<LI> 
<TT>\DIGIT</TT> 
After the end of a <TT>\( ... \)</TT> construct, the matcher remembers
the beginning and end of the text matched by that construct. 
Then, later on in the regular expression, you can use <TT>\</TT>
followed by DIGIT to mean "match the same text matched the
DIGIT'th time by the <TT>\( ... \)</TT> construct."  The <TT>\( ... \)</TT>
constructs are numbered in order of commencement in the regexp.<P>
The strings matching the first nine <TT>\( ... \)</TT> constructs
appearing in a regular expression are assigned numbers 1 through
9 in order of their beginnings. <TT>\1</TT> through <TT>\9</TT> may be used
to refer to the text matched by the corresponding <TT>\( ... \)</TT> 
construct.<P>
For example, <TT>\(.*\)\1</TT> matches any string that is composed of
two identical halves. The <TT>\(.*\)</TT> matches the first half,
which may be anything, but the <TT>\1</TT> that follows must match the
same exact text.<P>
<LI> 
<TT>\b</TT> 
matches the empty string, but only if it is at the beginning or
end of a word. Thus, <TT>\bfoo\b</TT> matches any occurrence of <TT>foo</TT>
as a separate word. <TT>\bball\(s\|\)\b</TT> matches <TT>ball</TT> or <TT>balls</TT>
as a separate word.<P>
<LI> 
<TT>\B</TT> 
matches the empty string, provided it is *not* at the beginning
or end of a word.<P>
<LI> 
<TT>\&lt;</TT> 
matches the empty string, but only if it is at the beginning of
a word.<P>
<LI> 
<TT>\&gt;</TT> 
matches the empty string, but only if it is at the end of a word.<P>
<LI> 
<TT>\w</TT> 
matches any word-constituent character.<P>
<LI> 
<TT>\W</TT> 
matches any character that is not a word-constituent.<P>
</UL>
